# Java Spring Boot
## Spring Boot
- It is a framework for building applications in the Java Programming Language.
- It makes it easy to create stand-alone, production-grade Spring based Applications that you can just run.
- The core Spring framework already reduces boilerplate code and provides a lot of helpful features for Java applications.
- However, Spring Boot takes this convenience to the next level by focusing specifically on reducing the effort required to set up and configure a Spring application.
- Auto-Configuration
- Standalone Applications
